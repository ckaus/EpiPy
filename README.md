# EpiPy
EpiPy is a tool for fitting epidemic models. This tool is developed for the course [Softwareprojekt Mobilkommunikation][1] at the [Freie Universit√§t Berlin][2].

## Introduction
Epidemics have been an interesting subject to study in many disciplines. Not only in epidemiology but also in biology, mathematics, sociology, computer science and more, the study of epidemics offers many areas for application. Mathematicians over time have suggested various models to understand and foresee the development of epidemics.

Several tools are available that can simulate epidemics and generate data with given parameter for an epidemic model. However, there is yet no tool for easy fitting of epidemic models. EpiPy simplifies the fitting of various models to data and aims to help you understand different epidemics models. It offers a range of possibilities for you to explore.

## Installation

### Windows

Requirements:

* [Python 2.7.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/)
