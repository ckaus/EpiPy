EpiPy
=====

EpiPy is a tool for fitting epidemic models. This tool is developed for
the course `Softwareprojekt
Mobilkommunikation <http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/inf/groups/ag-tech/teaching/2015-16_WS/P_19308912_Softwareprojekt_Mobilkommunikation/index.html>`__
at the `Freie Universität
Berlin <http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html>`__.

Introduction
------------

Epidemics have been an interesting subject to study in many disciplines.
Not only in epidemiology but also in biology, mathematics, sociology,
computer science and more, the study of epidemics offers many areas for
application. Mathematicians over time have suggested various models to
understand and foresee the development of epidemics.

Several tools are available that can simulate epidemics and generate
data with given parameter for an epidemic model. However, there is yet
no tool for easy fitting of epidemic models. EpiPy simplifies the
fitting of various models to data and aims to help you understand
different epidemics models. It offers a range of possibilities for you
to explore.
