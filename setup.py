 .
 Epidemics have been an interesting subject to study in many disciplines. Not
 only in epidemiology but also in biology, mathematics, sociology, computer
 science and more, the study of epidemics offers many areas for application.
 Mathematicians over time have suggested various models to understand and
 foresee the development of epidemics.
 .
 Several tools are available that can simulate epidemics and generate data with
 given parameter for an epidemic model. However, there is yet no tool for easy
 fitting of epidemic models. EpiPy simplifies the fitting of various models to
 data and aims to help you understand different epidemics models. It offers a
 range of possibilities for you
 to explore.
 .
 EpiPy support plotting epidemic data and fitted epidemic model.
 .
 Supported epidemic models:
  - SIR (Simple, With births and deaths, With Vaccine)
  - SIRS (Simple, With births and deaths)
  - SEIR (Simple)
